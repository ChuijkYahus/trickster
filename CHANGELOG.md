- Added Levitating Blocks. (@enjarai)
  - A block can now be levitated by applying a Featherweight Ploy to it.
  - These levitated blocks can be kept levitating by continually applying Featherweight Ploy.
  - Levitated blocks can be moved around using Kinetic Ploy, as if they were normal entities.
    - They may impart significant damage when striking living creatures at high velocity.
  - A levitated block will revert to its normal form when on solid ground and no longer affected by Featherweight.
    - It can be forced to convert back in midair by applying a Featherweight of 1 to it.
    - If a levitated block is inside a block that isn't naturally replaceable, it will never revert.
- Added Displacement. (@StellarWitch7 and @enjarai)
  - Displacement is a delayed means of teleportation.
  - When applying displacement to an entity, the mana cost scales exponentially with distance.
  - After the displacement is applied, and a few seconds of delay, the target entity will teleport by the given offset.
    - During the delay window, more displacements can be applied to the entity to modify its final destination.
    - If the entity takes damage from any source, the displacement is cancelled.
- Added Astral Knots. (@enjarai and @StellarWitch7)
  - This type of Knot is made from a Nether Star.
  - It does not regenerate mana from moonlight, but has a truly massive buffer, and has a unique mechanic associated with it.
- Improved block conversions. (Heating, Cooling and Weathering) (@Awakened-Redstone)
  - Fixed issues with waterlogging.
  - Fixed issues with blockstates not being preserved.
- Added the Acolyte's Bindings and the Archmage's Tether. (@StellarWitch7 and @enjarai)
  - Thanks for the textures Crephan!
- Improved Knot tooltips displaying merlin gain and drain. (@StellarWitch7)
- Updated changelog. (@enjarai)
